    st.markdown("""
### 1. Stocks / Shares

Represent part ownership in a company listed on the JSE. As a shareholder, you may receive dividends and benefit from a rising share price. The value of your investment may decrease depending on the companyâ€™s performance and overall stock market conditions. Suitable for investors with a high risk appetite and long-term goals.

---

### 2. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)

Listed investment products that track the performance of a group of shares (index), such as the FTSE/JSE Top 40. You are investing in a diversified basket of shares, which reduces risk compared to individual stocks. ETFs can be traded on the JSE like shares. Costs are lower than actively managed funds.

---

### 3. Bonds

Issued by government or corporations to raise funds. When you buy a bond, you are lending money in exchange for interest payments over a fixed term. Government bonds are low risk. Corporate bonds carry higher risk, but potentially higher returns. Bonds are suitable for income-seeking investors.

---

### 4. Collective Investment Schemes (CIS)

Pooled investments managed by professionals. Funds are spread across a variety of assets such as stocks, bonds, and property. Investors benefit from diversification and professional management. Examples: unit trusts, mutual funds. Risk varies based on fund allocation.

---

### 5. Participation Mortgage Bond Scheme

Investors pool funds to lend to property developers. The mortgage bond is registered over the property as security. Investors earn interest on the loan. Risk depends on property market conditions and borrower repayment ability.

---

### 6. Derivatives

Contracts whose value is derived from an underlying asset (e.g. shares, indices, currencies, commodities). Examples include options, futures, CFDs. Used for hedging or speculative purposes. High risk due to leverage and complexity. Suitable for advanced investors.
